              I just received a new pair of cross-country skis from our sponsor, SkiAnywhere, so I had to try them out! I took them on 
              a ten mile trek and they performed incredibly. They turned a simple outing into an unforgettable experience! The feeling
              of gliding across the snow on these things is just amazing.

              Look at that view. Isn't it incredible? It's the moments like these that make the whole thing worth it. It's not always 
              easy planning a trip, preparing for it, and then making the grueling climb up, but the feeling you get at the top is 
              simply indescribable. I could have sat there forever.

              It's my dog's birthday today, so I couldn't resist posting one of my favorite memories with him. Rex always brings 
              a fun energy to my trips, but last summer we had quite the experience together. After hiking nearly 20 miles in two
              days, his paws started to develop som hot spots. I made the mistake of putting him in my backpack and he liked it 
              so much he wouldn't get out the rest of the trip.
